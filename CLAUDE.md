Ensure all rust code conforms to `rust` skill.

Use `just check` for formatting and linting.
Use `just test` to run tests.

Never touch linter config without express user approval.
Always prefer refactors to suppressions, even when tedious. If suppressions are necessary, flag to the user.

Always commit with conventional commit formatted messages.

Math/algorithm ports from third-party repos must cite the source file:line in an inline comment. Aggregate attribution in `LICENSE-3RD-PARTY.md`. Do not reinvent ported scoring math; copy verbatim.

## Prefer `ast-outline` over full reads

Usage: ast-outline <COMMAND> [OPTIONS]

Commands:
  outline       Outline given files or directories (signatures with line ranges)
  digest        One-page module map
  show          Extract source of a symbol
  implements    Find subclasses / implementations
  surface       True public API surface (resolves `pub use` / `__all__`)
  deps          Forward import-graph traversal: what a file imports
  reverse-deps  Backward import-graph: who imports a file
  cycles        Find import cycles via Tarjan SCC
  graph         Emit the dep graph (text / JSON / DOT / DSM)
  search        Hybrid BM25 + dense semantic search over the repo
  find-related  Find chunks semantically similar to a given file:line
  index         Build, refresh, or inspect the per-repo search index
  prompt        Print this agent prompt snippet
  install       Install ast-outline into a coding-agent CLI
  uninstall     Remove ast-outline from a coding-agent CLI
  status        Report what's installed where
  mcp           Run as an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server over stdio

Each command has `--json` for stable schemas and `--compact` for single-line JSON. Pass an unknown flag or no command and the help text prints automatically — there's no "default" command, every operation is explicit.

Read structure with `ast-outline` before opening full contents. Pull method bodies only once you know which ones you need.

Stop at the step that answers the question:

1. **Unfamiliar directory** — `ast-outline digest <dir>`: one-page map of every file's types and public methods.

2. **One file's shape** — `ast-outline outline <file>`: signatures with line ranges, no bodies (5–10× smaller than a full read).

3. **One method, class, or markdown section** — `ast-outline show <file> <Symbol>`. Suffix matching: `TakeDamage`, or `Player.TakeDamage` when ambiguous. Multiple at once: `ast-outline show Player TakeDamage Heal Die`. For markdown, the symbol is the heading text.

4. **Who implements/extends a type** — `ast-outline implements <Type> <dir>`: AST-accurate (skip `grep`), transitive by default with `[via Parent]` tags on indirect matches. Add `--direct` for level-1 only.

5. **You don't know the file or symbol name** — `ast-outline search "<query>"`: hybrid BM25 + dense semantic search over the repo. Use bare identifiers for symbol lookup (`HandlerStack`, `Sinatra::Base` — auto-leans BM25), full sentences for behaviour search ("how does login work" — auto-balances semantic + BM25). First call builds an index at `.ast-outline/index/` (~seconds for typical repos); subsequent calls reuse it and refresh incrementally.

6. **Find code similar to a chunk you already have** — `ast-outline find-related <file>:<line>`: returns chunks semantically similar to the one containing that line. Useful for "what else looks like this?" or finding alternative implementations. Pastes directly from `search` output (which prints results as `path:start-end`).

7. **The actual published API of a package** — `ast-outline surface <dir>`: resolves `pub use` re-exports (Rust) and `__all__` (Python) so you see exactly what a downstream user can reach, not the union of every `pub`/non-underscore item. Falls back to visibility-filtered output for Java/C#/Go/Kotlin (no real re-export concept). Use `--tree` for hierarchy, `--include-chain` to see the re-export path each entry took.

8. **What does this file pull in / who depends on it / are there cycles?** — file-level dep-graph commands. First call builds a graph at `.ast-outline/deps/graph.bin` (~hundreds of ms for typical repos); subsequent calls reuse it.
   - `ast-outline deps <file> [--depth N]`: forward — what `<file>` imports (transitively).
   - `ast-outline reverse-deps <file> [--depth N]`: backward — who imports `<file>`. Use before refactoring to know the blast radius.
   - `ast-outline cycles [<dir>]`: import cycles via Tarjan SCC. Exits non-zero when cycles exist (CI gate).
   - `ast-outline graph [<dir>] --format text|json|dot|dsm`: emit the full graph. `dsm` is a Design Structure Matrix sorted by Lakos level — visual cycle/inversion spotter.

Fall back to a full read only when you need context beyond the body `show` returned. If the outline header contains `# WARNING: N parse errors`, the outline for that file is partial — read the source directly for the affected region.
